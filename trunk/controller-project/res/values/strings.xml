    <string name="BotBuilderDescription">The "Bot Builder" station involves blue robot #1.\n\nIn this station, students learn about how the robots are constructed.  We talk about wires, motors, controllers, and phones.  The station has a robot wired to a tablet, and students hold the tablet and press buttons to control the robot.\n\nTODO: The drivethebotlayout needs to be made prettier and more intuitive.  The current buttons do not make sense: instead of toggle, we might just want regular buttons.  We should have a STOP button, too.  Finally, we should rename the button IDs for more clarity.</string>
    <string name="RemoteControlDescription">The "Remote Control" station involves blue robot #2.\n\nIn this station, students are introduced to the idea of wireless control and cameras.  The station has a robot with a built-in tablet, and a phone as the controller.  Students use the phone to move the robot.  They can also have the robot take pictures.\n\nTODO: One activity is used for both the phone and robot right now... that needs to change.  Plenty of other work will result.</string>
